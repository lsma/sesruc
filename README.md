Curses platformer

Simple platformer written in python.  Uses curses for graphics (ie, command line graphics)
Currently, the game data is incomplete.  Creating stages/story/dialog is the hardest part.  I have the basic 'engine' down, now I just need to create new maps (stages, or levels (I use all the terms for the same thing)) ans storylines.
